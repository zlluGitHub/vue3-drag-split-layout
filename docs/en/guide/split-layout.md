# SplitLayout usage

## Basic examples

It is recommended to place `SplitLayout` in the top-level component or `CodeLayout`'s `centerArea` slot and set the width and height to fill the screen.

To use SplitLayout, there are the following steps:

1. [Import Components](./install.md#global-import-components).
2. Defining Slots and Content: In components, content is organized on a "panel" basis, so panel data needs to be added and then rendered in the slots.

For example:

::: my-sandbox {template=vue3-ts}

```ts /src/main.ts
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import CodeLayout from 'vue3-drag-split-layout'
import 'vue3-drag-split-layout/lib/vue3-drag-split-layout.css'

createApp(App)
  .use(CodeLayout)
  .mount('#app')  
```

```vue /src/App.vue [active]
<template>
  <div class="demo">
    <SplitLayout
      ref="splitLayoutRef"
      @canLoadLayout="loadLayout"
      @panelClose="onPanelClose"
    >
      <template #tabContentRender="{ panel }">
        <!--
          Each panel will call this slot for rendering, and you can customize it based on panel.name is used to determine which panel is currently present and render the corresponding content
          panel.data Can store custom data
        -->
        <h2 :style="{ backgroundColor: colors[panel.data] }">Grid {{ panel.name }}</h2>
      </template>
      <template #tabEmptyContentRender="{ grid }">
        <h2>
          Empty Grid {{ grid.name }}
          <br><button @click="onAddPanel(grid)">+ Add</button>
        </h2>
      </template>
      <template #tabHeaderExtraRender="{ grid }">
        <button @click="onAddPanel(grid)">+ Add</button>
      </template>
    </SplitLayout>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>

## Panel operation

Definition:

* **Grid**：A grid is a container that can contain multiple panels, composed in Tab mode, but can only have one displayed panel at the same time; Alternatively, it can be a parent panel that contains sub grids divided in different directions. The parent panel has two layout directions, horizontal and vertical. The layout direction is only used for sub grids, and the sub panels are displayed in Tab mode.
* **Panel**：Panel, the content is organized in units of "panels", and the panel is the basic unit that ultimately allows you to render the content. Users can drag and close each panel.

You can add your panels to the components, or obtain panel instances for corresponding operations.

To operate the SplitLayout component, you need to first obtain its instance, and then call the method on the instance:

```ts
import { CodeLayoutSplitNInstance } from 'vue3-drag-split-layout';

//Bind the splitLayoutRef variable to the SplitLayout component through the ref attribute
const splitLayoutRef = ref<CodeLayoutSplitNInstance>();
```

### Get Root Grid

The component provides a method to obtain the root grid:

```ts
const grid = splitLayoutRef.value.getRootGrid();
```

### Root Grid Direction

The default layout direction for the root grid is horizontal (layout direction is only used for sub grids, sub panels are displayed in Tab mode), You can also change it to vertical.

```ts
const grid = splitLayoutRef.value.getRootGrid();
grid.direction = 'vertical';
```

### Add Grid/Panel

You can add a grid to the root, for example, the following code adds a grid to the root:

```ts
const grid1 = grid.addGrid({
  name: 'grid1',
  visible: true,
  size: 0,
});
```

The default direction of the grid is perpendicular to the parent, for example, if the parent grid is horizontal, the added sub grid direction is vertical.

After obtaining the grid, you can add panels to the custom grid:

```ts
grid1.addPanel({
  title: `Panel title`,
  tooltip: `Panel Help`,
  name: `datahelp`,
  iconSmall: () => h(IconMarkdown),
});
```

Note: The 'name' attribute of the panel must be unique, but it is not required for the grid.

### Get panel

When adding a panel, the 'name' attribute must be unique, so you can use name to query the added panel instance:

```ts
//Add panels to obtain panels and modify badge
const file1 = splitLayoutRef.value.getPanelByName('file1')
file1.badge = '3';
```

### Close panel

User can close panel.

#### Close button

The panel supports the close button. When creating the panel, you can specify the close button or modify the properties after obtaining the instance:

```ts
const grid1 = grid.addGrid({
  name: 'grid1',
  visible: true,
  size: 0,
  closeType: 'close', //Display close button
});
```

```ts
//Obtain panels and modify closeType
const file1 = splitLayoutRef.value.getPanelByName('file1')
file1.closeType = 'unSave';
```

![Close](../../images/SplitLayoutTitleClose.jpg)

* unSave Display a dot to indicate that the current file has not been saved
* close Display a close button (x)
* none No close button (default)

#### Close processing

After setting the close button, when the user clicks the close button, the `panelClose` event will be triggered at the top level, where you can handle your own business logic,
Save the file, etc. You can perform the closing operation asynchronously, and then call resolve to delete the panel, or call reject to cancel the deletion of the panel.

```ts
//Close callback
function onPanelClose(panel: CodeLayoutPanelInternal, resolve: () => void, reject: (e: any) => void) {
  console.log('onPanelClose', panel.name);
  resolve();
}
```

#### Manual close

In the code, the `closePanel` `function on the panel instance can also be manually called to perform a close operation, which is consistent with the user's click to close.

```ts
const file1 = splitLayoutRef.value.getPanelByName('file1')
file1.closePanel();
```

### Prohibit automatic grid shrinkage

Users are allowed to drag and drop panels between grids. By default, when all panels in a grid are removed, the panel will automatically shrink (removing itself) to make space for other panels.

If you do not want the grids you manually added to be removed, you can specify that shrinking is not allowed when creating the panels, so that when the grid is empty, it will not be removed, and the tabEmptyContentRender slot will be called during rendering, where you can render custom content.

```ts
const grid1 = grid.addGrid({
  name: 'grid1',
  visible: true,
  size: 0,
  noAutoShink: true,
});
```

## Badge, Icon, Title, Actions

A panel supports the following configuration fields to control the display of some information, and its display position is shown in the figure:

![SplitLayoutTitle](../../images/SplitLayoutTitle.jpg)

You can specify these properties during creation or modify them through instance properties after creation.

```ts
grid2.addPanel({
  name: 'file1',
  //Tile text
  title: 'File name',
  //Tooltips displayed when hovering the mouse
  tooltip: 'File path',
  //badge, recommended within 2 digits
  badge: '2', 
  //Icon
  iconSmall: () => h(IconFile), 
  //Custom actions, which will be displayed as buttons on the right side of the header when the panel is activated
  actions: [
    { 
      name: 'test',
      icon: () => h(IconSearch),
      onClick() {},
    },
    { 
      name: 'test2',
      icon: () => h(IconFile),
      onClick() {},
    },
  ]
});
```

## Saving and Loading Data

SplitLayout supports you to save user dragged layouts to JSON data, and then reload and restore the original layout from JSON data on the next entry.

SplitLayout supports two events, `canLoadLayout` and `canSaveLayout`. In the event callback, the current component instance will be returned. You can perform load and save operations in the event callback, or at other times, you can freely control the load and save operations by calling the `loadLayout` and `saveLayout` functions on the component instance.

```vue
<template>
  <SplitLayout 
    ref="splitLayout"
    style="height: 400px"
    @canLoadLayout="loadLayout"
    @canSaveLayout="saveLayout"
  />
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
const splitLayout = ref<CodeLayoutSplitNInstance>();

//Load and save operations can be performed in event callbacks, which are triggered by default during component initialization and uninstallation
//The event will pass the component instance ref, which can be directly called, equivalent to splitLayout.value
function loadLayout(ref: CodeLayoutSplitNInstance) {
  //Load here
}
function saveLayout(ref: CodeLayoutSplitNInstance) {
  //Save here
}

//You can also load/save data by calling component instance methods at other custom times
onMounted(() => {
  splitLayout.value.loadLayout();
})
</script>
```

### Save data

Save layout data by calling the `saveLayout` method.

```ts
const json = splitLayout.value.saveLayout();
localStorage.setItem('SplitLayoutData', json);
```

### Load data

Layout data only stores the basic position, size, and other information of each layout, and does not contain information that cannot be serialized (such as callback functions and icons). Therefore, loading layout data requires calling the `loadLayout` method on the instance to instantiate the panel based on its name.

```ts
const data = localStorage.getItem('SplitLayoutData');
if (data) {
  //If load layout from data, need fill panel data
  splitLayout.value.loadLayout(JSON.parse(data), (panel) => {
    switch (panel.name) {
      case 'file1':
        panel.title = 'File 1';
        panel.tooltip = 'File 1 path';
        panel.badge = '2';
        panel.iconLarge = () => h(IconFile);
        break;
    }
    return panel;
  });
} else {
  //No data, create new layout
  //...
}
```

## TIP: Component unmont

Tip: Vue may unmont and recreate your components in the following two situations:

* Users drag and drop a panel to another panel
* In development mode, when you modify the code, HMR overloads

At this point, Vue may unmont and recreate your component, causing the component state to be lost. Therefore, you need to handle your own component and save the relevant state.
